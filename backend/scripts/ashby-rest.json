You’ll also be the connective tissue between our GTM teams and the data infrastructure that shows us who to target, how to win, and where to expand.\n\n\nWHAT YOU'LL DO\n\n - Build Rain’s GTM systems from the ground up — architect the CRM, workflows, routing logic, and automations that power BD, Marketing, and Customer Success\n\n - Design and own opportunity, pipeline, and deal-acceleration workflows, ensuring every stage is clear, measurable, and efficient\n\n - Implement AI-native automations that surface next-best actions, trigger follow-ups, and reduce manual work across GTM teams\n\n - Unify the GTM tech stack (CRM, sequencing tools, data enrichment, call intelligence, analytics) into one scalable, coherent system\n\n - Partner with BD leadership to establish operating rhythms: forecasting, pipeline reviews, account planning, renewal workflows\n\n - Ensure clean, trustworthy data — implement controls, validation, QA, and governance to maintain high-quality GTM intelligence\n\n - Build dashboards and reporting layers that give BD, Marketing, CS, and Execs visibility into pipeline health, funnel performance, and revenue drivers\n\n - Work with Product and Data to integrate product usage signals into GTM workflows for scoring, expansion, and proactive outreach\n\n - Streamline customer handoffs from BD → Implementations → Customer Success → Growth\n\n - Continuously improve the GTM foundation, recommending new tools, refining processes, and raising operational throughput across the org\n\n\nWHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR\n\n - A systems-first GTM builder — you’ve designed or owned GTM workflows, pipelines, and automations at a high-growth B2B company\n\n - Technical and hands-on — strong familiarity with CRM configuration, workflow logic, GTM tools, and SQL\n\n - AI-native — you actively use AI tools, understand their tradeoffs, and know how to automate GTM motions intelligently\n\n - Commercially minded — you understand how revenue is generated, where deals get stuck, and how to create leverage across the funnel\n\n - Customer-centric — you care about clean handoffs, predictable experience, and giving GTM teams the information they need to win\n\n - Clear communicator — able to translate GTM complexity into simple workflows and dashboards that teams rely on\n\n - Execution-driven — you ship quickly, iterate fast, and solve problems before they become blockers\n\n - Experienced — 4–7+ years in GTM Ops, RevOps, Sales Ops, Sales Engineering, or adjacent roles at fast-growing B2B SaaS, fintech, or payments companies\n\n\nNICE TO HAVE, BUT NOT MANDATORY\n\n - Experience as a founding or early GTM systems hire\n\n - Experience with stablecoins, payments, card programs, or financial infrastructure\n\n - Prior work with outbound automation, AI agents, or GTM experimentation frameworks\n\n - Background integrating product usage data into sales workflows\n\n - Salesforce or HubSpot admin experience\n\n\nTHINGS THAT ENABLE A FULFILLING, HEALTHY, AND HAPPY EXPERIENCE AT RAIN:\n\n - Unlimited time off 🌴 Unlimited vacation can be daunting, so we require Rainmakers to take at least 10 days off.\n\n - Flexible working ☕ We support a flexible workplace. If you feel comfortable at home, please work from home. If you’d like to work with others in an office, feel free to come in. We want everyone to be able to work in the environment in which they are their most confident and productive selves.
